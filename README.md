Steps to Follow:
Find winrar.exe:
Locate where winrar.exe is installed on your system. This is usually in a directory like C:\Program Files\WinRAR\winrar.exe.

Update the Script:
Replace C:\\Path\\To\\WinRAR\\winrar.exe in the script with the actual path to winrar.exe.

Verify winrar:
Open a Command Prompt and type winrar to see if it runs. If it doesnâ€™t, the executable is not in your PATH.

Add winrar to PATH (Optional):
If you prefer to add winrar to your system PATH instead of hardcoding the path in the script:

Right-click on 'This PC' or 'Computer' on your desktop or in File Explorer, and select 'Properties'.
Click 'Advanced system settings'.
Click 'Environment Variables'.
In the 'System variables' section, find the Path variable and select it. Click 'Edit'.
Click 'New' and add the path to the directory containing winrar.exe (e.g., C:\Program Files\WinRAR).
Click 'OK' to close all dialog boxes.
